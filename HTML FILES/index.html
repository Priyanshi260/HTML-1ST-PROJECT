    <h1> THIRD LAW OF MOTION </h1> </header> <hr>
    <p> Force is a push or pull acting on an object resulting in its interaction with another object. Force is a result of an interaction. Force can be classified into two categories: contact force such as frictional force and non-contact force such as gravitational force. According to Newton, when two bodies interact, they exert force on each other, and these forces are known as action and reaction pairs, which is explained in Newton’s third law of motion. <br> Newton’s third law of motion states that : </p>
    <b><i><u> “When one body exerts a force on the other body, the first body experiences a force which is equal in magnitude in the opposite direction of the force which is exerted”.</u></i></b>
    <p> So the equation of third law of motion is :</p>
    <p> F<sub>AB</sub> = - F<sub>BA</sub></p><br><br>
