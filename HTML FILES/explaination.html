    <pre> This image illustrates Newton‚Äôs Third Law of Motion, which states:

       <b><i><u> "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."</b></i></u>
        
        üîç In the image:
        <b>A person is pushing backward (action) with their leg.</b>
        
       <b> The boat moves forward (reaction). </b>
        
        The force applied by the person on the boat causes the boat to push back with an equal force in the opposite direction, making the person move backward too if not balanced.
        
        üß† Key idea: Forces always come in pairs ‚Äî if object A exerts a force on object B, object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A.
